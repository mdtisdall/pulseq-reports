# Design: separate checks from reports (pulseq-checks)

Mode: Strict STE100. Structural rules are enforced. Lexical rules are a
direction of travel, not a verified dictionary match.

Status: design. The design was written on 2026-09-30, from a discussion with
the user. The user answered the open decisions on the same day (section 11).
This is not an implementation plan. It gives the concepts, the structure and
the decisions. An implementation plan comes next.

## 1. Goal

The library mixes two different uses:

1. **Check** a sequence. A check compares a sequence with a specification, for
   example the hardware limits of one scanner, and gives pass or fail. CI uses
   checks. A check must be fast, its result must be binary, and its
   specification must be clear to a person who reads it.
2. **Report** on a sequence. A report describes how a sequence behaves. It
   helps a person see trade-offs and make design decisions.

This design separates the two uses. Checks move to a new pure-Python library,
`pulseq-checks`. `pulseq-reports` uses `pulseq-checks`, and a report can show
the results of the checks. The main goal of a report is still to describe the
sequence, not to run the checks.

The key behavior of `pulseq-checks` is this: apply a specification to a `.seq`
file, when the author of the file did not use that specification. For
example, check a file that was written for one scanner against the limits of
a different scanner.

## 2. Two uses

| | Check | Report |
|---|---|---|
| Question | "Does this sequence meet specification X?" | "How does this sequence behave?" |
| Inputs | The sequence and a specification. The specification is necessary. | The sequence. Context is optional. |
| Output | Pass, fail or not evaluated, for each named rule. A machine can read it. | An HTML page that describes the sequence. It needs no verdict. |
| Cost | Fast. It calculates only what its rules need. | It can be slow and complete. |
| Defaults | No default limits. A missing input is an error. | Sensible defaults are permitted. |
| Definition | A written specification: the quantity, its definition, the limit, the tolerance and the pass condition. | The documentation of the card. |

A report can include the results of the checks. A shared report then tells
its reader which assertions pass. But the report does not define a check, and
the report is not the tool that CI uses to run the checks.

## 3. The state of the code (2026-09-30, `main` at `fd298d5`)

The two uses are mixed in five places:

1. **A check is a part of a card.** `Check` is a field of `Card`
   (`src/pulseq_reports/page.py:39`). The only checks are the timing check,
   the gradient limits check and the PNS check. Each check is calculated when
   its card is built. To get a pass or fail result, CI must build the full
   report, with the diagram, the spectrum and the RF profiles.
2. **One code path gives the verdict and draws the card.** The PNS check is
   "the rule of the status line" (`src/pulseq_reports/cards/pns.py:61`). No
   document gives the rule as a specification.
3. **Missing inputs get silent defaults.** With no limits, the gradient check
   uses `seq.system`, which is what the sequence says about itself. The
   command line writes only a warning (`src/pulseq_reports/cli.py`,
   `_write_pages`). With no `.asc` file, the PNS check uses the example
   hardware of pypulseq (`asc.EXAMPLE_HARDWARE`). A pass against limits that
   are not real is not a compliance result.
4. **The settings of a check are card options.** `check_norms` is an option
   of the gradient limits card (`src/pulseq_reports/options.py`). The limits,
   the `.asc` file and the coil are card options. They do not describe a
   scanner as one object.
5. **"Could not calculate" and "failed" are the same result.** When a card
   raises an exception, `registry.py:306` gives it a failed check with the
   name `error`. The exit status of `pulseq-report` mixes "a check failed"
   with "the page was written".

`Card.checks` and the exit status 2 are new in `0.2.0rc2` (#91, #92). No
final release has them yet.

## 4. What pypulseq already gives

Facts from pypulseq `1.5.0.post1`, the version that the library pins.

| Check | In pypulseq? | What pypulseq has |
|---|---|---|
| Timing | Yes | `check_timing` returns `(ok, errors)`. It checks the rasters, the block duration, negative delays, the RF dead time and ringdown, the ADC dead times and the soft delays. |
| PNS | Yes | `calculate_pns` returns `ok = all(pns_norm < 1)`. The PNS card uses this SAFE model. |
| Gradient amplitude, each axis | Partly | Only when a sequence is built. `make_trapezoid`, `make_arbitrary_grad` and `make_extended_trapezoid` raise an error above `system.max_grad`. |
| Gradient slew, each axis | Partly | Only when a sequence is built. The same functions check the slew. `add_block` checks the steps at block junctions. All use `seq.system`. |
| \|G\| amplitude and slew | Values only | `test_report` writes the maximum of \|G\| and of its slew as text. It gives no verdict. |
| Acoustic resonances | Data and plot only | `asc_to_hw` reads the resonance frequencies and bandwidths from the `.asc` file. `calculate_gradient_spectrum` draws them. It gives no verdict. |
| RF peak B1, B1+rms, SAR | No | `calc_SAR` was removed. It raises an error that names PySar4seq. `Opts` has no B1 limits. |

Two more facts make "apply a new specification to a file" possible:

- `seq.read` does not read the hardware values from the file. The RF dead
  time, the RF ringdown and the ADC dead time come from the `Opts` that the
  caller gives to `pp.Sequence(system=...)`. The file gives only the raster
  times, in `[DEFINITIONS]`.
- `check_timing` compares with `seq.system`. Thus it compares with the
  specification that the caller gives, not with the values of the author.

Conclusion: for timing and PNS, pypulseq has the rule. A check in
`pulseq-checks` is a thin wrapper. For the gradient limits of a finished
file, pypulseq has no check. This gap is the main new function. The
measurement exists already, in `grad_limits.py`.

## 5. Design

### 5.1 Layers

There are three layers. Each layer uses only the layers below it.

| Layer | Package | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| Measurements | `pulseq-checks` | Calculations only: the gradient peaks and slew, PNS, and later the spectrum and RF exposure. Each measurement gives values and where they occur. It gives no verdict. |
| Checks | `pulseq-checks` | Target profiles, models, check rules, results and the `pulseq-check` command. |
| Reports | `pulseq-reports` | Cards, the page, the JavaScript and the `pulseq-report` command. A card describes. A card does not decide. |

`pulseq-reports` uses `pulseq-checks`. `pulseq-checks` never uses
`pulseq-reports`. The package boundary enforces this direction.

### 5.2 The parts of a check

Four parts change independently. Each part is a plugin point.

| Part | What it is | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Target profile | What one scanner and its Pulseq interpreter can do, and what they expect | Rasters, dead times, gradient limits, B0, the coil `.asc` file, the supported file versions and extensions, coordinate conventions |
| Profile reader | Makes a target profile from vendor files | A Siemens `.asc` reader now. GE and Philips readers later. |
| Model | Calculates a physical quantity from a sequence and a target | SAFE PNS (pypulseq), a dB/dt model, a neurodynamic body model, a SAR model |
| Check rule | Compares a quantity with a limit. It has a written specification. | "The PNS is below 100 %." "The slew of each physical axis is at or below the limit." |

A new PNS model is a new model plugin. The PNS check rule does not change.
The target profile tells which model applies to that scanner.

Each check rule declares the profile fields and the models that it needs.

A target profile is a TOML or JSON file. It gives the vendor, the rasters,
the dead times, B0 and the gradient limits. It can name a Siemens `.asc`
file. The `.asc` file gives the SAFE parameters, the acoustic resonances and
the GPA limits. When the profile file and the `.asc` file both give one
value, the result is an error, not a silent override (decision 6). A site
keeps its profiles where it wants, for example next to its sequences.

`HardwareLimits` moves to `pulseq-checks`, and a target profile contains it.
`pulseq-reports` exports it again, so its callers do not break (decision 8).
The target profile replaces the card options `limits`, `gradient_asc` and
`check_norms`. A report can use a target profile as context, for example to
show a limit as a line on a chart.

### 5.3 Results

Each result has:

- the check ID and the version of its specification,
- the target,
- the state: pass, fail or not evaluated,
- the measured value, the limit and where the value occurs (block and time),
- the model and its version, when the check uses a model,
- the reason, when the state is "not evaluated".

"Not evaluated" is a state of its own. It is not a pass and not a fail. A
check gets it when the target profile does not have a necessary field, or
when a necessary model is not available. Examples:

- PNS with no `.asc` file: not evaluated. The pypulseq example hardware is
  not a real scanner, so it does not give a pass.
- Handedness with no declared convention: not evaluated (section 6.2).

A check run takes one sequence and a list of targets. The result is a matrix
of checks and targets. The same matrix is the output for CI and the summary
in a report.

### 5.4 The specification of each check

Each check has a stable ID, for example `gradient.slew.axis`. A document in
`pulseq-checks` gives one entry for each ID:

- the quantity and its exact definition,
- the inputs from the target profile,
- the limit and the tolerance,
- the pass condition,
- the cost (fast, or slow for a large file),
- the pypulseq function that the check uses, if any.

The message of a result gives the ID, so that a reader can find the
specification. The specification has a version. When a rule changes, its
version changes, so that old CI results stay clear.

### 5.5 Checks in a report

When the caller gives one or more target profiles, the report runs the checks
through the same function that `pulseq-check` uses. A caller can also give a
result set that was calculated before. The same code gives the verdict in CI
and in a shared report, so the two cannot disagree.

The report shows a summary of the checks near the top of the page:

- the target profiles and the source of each limit,
- for each check and target: the ID, the state, the value and the limit, the
  location, and a link to the specification,
- each "not evaluated" result, with its reason. The reader must see what was
  not asserted, not only what passed.

A card can point to a result, for example the "Show" button of the gradient
limits card on the value that failed. The descriptive cards do not decide.

With no target profile, the report is complete. The summary says that no
checks were run. It does not use default limits.

### 5.6 The commands and the exit status

`pulseq-check`, in `pulseq-checks`:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | Each check passed. Each required check was evaluated. |
| 2 | At least one check failed. |
| 1 | An error in the arguments or the profiles, or a required check that was not evaluated. |

A check is required when the caller names it, in the configuration file or
with a flag. A check that runs by default and does not have its inputs gives
"not evaluated" in the output, and the status does not change (decision 3).

A check uses the limits of the sequence (`seq.system`) only when the caller
permits it explicitly, with a flag or an entry in the profile. The result
records that the limits came from the sequence (decision 4).

The command writes a result that a machine can read (JSON, and maybe
JUnit XML for CI dashboards) and a short summary for a person.

`pulseq-report`, in `pulseq-reports`: the status is 0 when each page is
written, also when a check in the summary failed. To stop CI on a failed
check is the work of `pulseq-check`. An opt-in flag, for example
`--fail-on-check`, makes the report command give a non-zero status when a
check in its summary fails (decision 2).

### 5.7 Plugins

`pulseq-checks` has three entry-point groups: profile readers, models and
check rules. `pulseq-reports` keeps its entry-point group for cards. A
project can add a check for its site without a card.

Each package has its own command line (decision 9). `pulseq-checks` has a
public function that reads a check configuration: the targets and the
selected checks. `pulseq-reports` keeps its card options (`options.py`,
`cli.py`) and calls that function. Thus the two commands read the same check
configuration file.

### 5.8 Rely on pypulseq

A check uses the pypulseq rule when pypulseq has one. The timing check calls
`check_timing`. The PNS check calls the SAFE model of pypulseq. The gradient
limits check uses the slew definition of pypulseq
(`docs/notes/slew-definitions.md`). `pulseq-checks` does not copy a rule that
pypulseq has.

### 5.9 Cost classes

Each check declares a cost class, `fast` or `slow` (decision 7). The cost
class is one field of the specification of the check, and its default is
`slow`. Thus a plugin check that nobody measured does not make the fast set
slow. A plugin author changes one field to put a check in the fast set.

The caller can select checks, or run only the fast checks. The fast checks of
`pulseq-checks` have a tested time budget on a file with 10⁶ blocks. The
implementation plan sets the number after a measurement. The budget test does
not include plugin checks. A plugin author can use the same timing helper to
measure a plugin check.

### 5.10 Rasters

`seq.read` keeps the raster times of the file. `check_timing` uses the
rasters of `seq.system`, which come from the target. A separate check, the
raster check, compares the rasters that the file declares with the rasters of
the target. The target profile gives the rule: equal, or an integer multiple.
The timing check then runs with the rasters of the target (decision 5).

## 6. Kinds of checks that we can see now

The design must accept these kinds without a new structure. Version 1 does
only some of them (section 8). Many of them come from one need: to use one
`.seq` file on different scanners, possibly from different vendors.

### 6.1 The kinds

| Kind | Examples | Possible from the `.seq` file only? |
|---|---|---|
| Timing and rasters | The rasters of the gradients, RF, ADC and blocks are different for each vendor (for example, 10 µs gradient raster on Siemens, 4 µs on GE). Dead times and ringdown. The ADC dwell step. | Yes, with a target profile. `check_timing` already takes these values from `Opts`. |
| Gradient hardware | Amplitude and slew. The limit on each physical axis or on the vector. A slew limit that decreases at high amplitude. Gradient RMS, duty cycle and heating over a time window. Acoustic resonance bands. | Yes, with a target profile. |
| Worst case under rotation | Does the sequence pass at the planned orientation, or at all orientations? This makes the \|G\| note of the gradient limits card into a check. | Yes. |
| Physiological safety | PNS, with more than one model. Cardiac stimulation (`asc_to_hw` has `cardiac_model`). The dB/dt operating mode (normal or first level, IEC 60601-2-33). Acoustic noise. | Yes, with a model. |
| RF and field strength | Peak B1 against the RF amplifier and coil of the target. SAR, which increases approximately with B0². A frequency offset in Hz that is correct at only one B0 (for example, fat saturation). pypulseq 1.5 can give such offsets in ppm. | Partly. A Hz offset needs a declared B0. |
| Interpreter compatibility | The Pulseq file version. The supported extensions (soft delays, rotations, triggers, RF use). Limits on the library size, the number of blocks, the ADC samples and the waveform length. Label and counter ranges. Structural rules of one vendor's interpreter. | Yes, with a target profile. |
| Coordinate and sign conventions | The handedness of the logical axes relative to the patient. Which physical axis each logical axis goes to. The sign of the RF phase and frequency offset relative to the gradient polarity. The direction of a slice or readout offset. | **No. It needs a declaration** (section 6.2). |
| Nucleus | A gamma that is not the proton gamma. Does the RF chain of the target support that nucleus? | Yes, with a target profile. |

### 6.2 Coordinate conventions and handedness

This kind is different from the others. A `.seq` file does not record the
convention that its author used. A gradient polarity and an RF frequency
offset are consistent in each handedness. The only difference is that the
slice is at the mirror position. Thus no check can find "wrong handedness"
from the waveforms only.

Two checks are possible:

1. **Declared against expected.** The sequence declares its conventions: the
   handedness, the axis mapping, and the signs of the phase and the frequency
   offset. The target profile gives what its interpreter expects. The check
   compares the two. With no declaration, the result is "not evaluated". In a
   report for several sites, this is the correct result to show.
2. **Internal consistency against the declaration.** For each slice-selective
   RF pulse, the frequency offset must be γ·G·position, with the declared
   sign. This check finds a sign error inside one sequence, also when all the
   scanners agree.

The correct location for the declaration is the `[DEFINITIONS]` section of
the `.seq` file. That is a convention for the Pulseq community. This library
must not invent it alone.

TODO (decision 10): the location of the declaration is deferred. Version 1
has no convention checks. When `pulseq-checks` exists, this item goes into its
`TODO.md`.

## 7. Two packages

### 7.1 Why a separate package

1. **The dependency goes in one direction.** Reports use checks. Checks never
   use reports. A package boundary enforces this. In one package, only
   discipline enforces it, and the current problem started when the two uses
   were in one package.
2. **Different promises.** Checks are a contract. The check IDs, the
   specifications, the profile format and the model versions must stay
   stable, because CI results and compliance records refer to them. Reports
   are presentation. Cards, layout and JavaScript must be free to change
   quickly. Two version numbers let each package keep its own promise.
3. **Different people.** Scanner physicists and people who work with vendors
   will write target profiles, profile readers and models. Many of them will
   not open a report. Sequence developers write cards. Two repositories keep
   the issues, the documents and the plugin groups separate.
4. **Upstream.** The Pulseq community can adopt a small pure-Python check
   library more easily than a report generator. Parts of it can move to
   pypulseq, for example a gradient limits check of a finished file, or a
   convention declaration.

The removal of the JavaScript is a small reason only. The JavaScript is
static files in the wheel. Both packages use only `pypulseq`, `numpy` and
`scipy`. A user of the checks gets a smaller API and fewer documents, not
fewer dependencies.

### 7.2 What moves

The measurement modules that the checks need import nothing from the report
side:

| Module | Imports in the package |
|---|---|
| `grad_limits` | `seq_index`, `seq_utils` |
| `pns` | `pns_levels`, `seq_index` |
| `pns_levels` | `asc`, `extensions`, `sampling`, `seq_index` |
| `sampling` | `seq_index`, `seq_utils` |
| `asc`, `extensions`, `seq_index`, `seq_utils` | none |
| `grad_spectrum` | `sampling`, `seq_index` |
| `rf_exposure` | none |

For version 1, these modules move to `pulseq-checks`, with their tests:
`grad_limits`, `pns`, `pns_levels`, `asc`, `extensions`, `sampling`,
`seq_index` and `seq_utils`. `grad_spectrum` and `rf_exposure` move when a
check needs them (the acoustic check and the RF checks).

These stay in `pulseq-reports`: the cards, the page, the JavaScript,
`waveforms` (it imports `markup`), `markup`, `rf_profiles`, `rf_sim`,
`profile_metrics`, `diagram_data`, the registry of cards and the
`pulseq-report` command.

`pulseq-reports` depends on `pulseq-checks` by git URL and tag, as its
consumers depend on it.

### 7.3 Costs

- Two repositories to operate: CI, releases, tokens and the dev-workflow
  setup.
- A change that touches both packages needs two pull requests, in sequence.
  First `pulseq-checks`, then `pulseq-reports` changes its pin. There will be
  more of these changes at the start, while the measurement code changes for
  the checks.
- The option and configuration code of the command line (section 5.7).

## 8. Version 1

Version 1 is small:

- one target profile format (TOML or JSON), and a Siemens `.asc` profile
  reader,
- a list of targets for each check run,
- the cost classes and the time budget of the fast checks (section 5.9),
- the raster check (section 5.10),
- the timing check (a wrapper of `check_timing`),
- the gradient amplitude check and the gradient slew check of each axis, for
  a finished file,
- the worst-case amplitude under rotation: the peak of \|G\| against the
  amplitude limit. It replaces `check_norms` (decision 11).
- the PNS check with the SAFE model of pypulseq, only with a real `.asc` file,
- the result matrix, the JSON output and the `pulseq-check` command,
- the check summary card in `pulseq-reports`, and its `--fail-on-check` flag.

The worst-case slew under rotation needs a vector slew measurement. The
library does not have one yet, so that check comes later. The convention
checks come later (decision 10). The other kinds of section 6 come later.
The structure of section 5 accepts them without a new design.

## 9. Order of work

1. **Before `0.2.0` final.** Remove `Card.checks`, the `check_norms` option
   and the exit status 2 from `pulseq-reports`. Then no final release has an
   API that this design removes (decision 1). `HardwareLimits` stays. The
   gradient limits card uses it to show the percent of each limit, with no
   verdict.
2. **Make `pulseq-checks`** (`mdtisdall/pulseq-checks`, decision 12). Use the
   dev-workflow `project-setup` skill. Move
   the measurement modules of section 7.2 with their tests. Add the target
   profile, the profile reader, the check rules, the results and
   `pulseq-check`. Compare the results of the new timing, gradient and PNS
   checks with the current checks of the cards.
3. **Change `pulseq-reports` to use `pulseq-checks`.** Remove the copies of the
   moved modules. Export `HardwareLimits` again from `pulseq_reports`. Add the
   check summary card and `--fail-on-check`. Update `docs/usage.md`,
   `TESTS.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`.
4. **Later.** More kinds of checks (section 6), more profile readers, JUnit
   output, and proposals to pypulseq.

Step 2 is a move, with no stage inside this repository. Thus the check layer
is not built two times.

## 10. Rules for the implementation plan

- The rules of `CLAUDE.md` apply to each repository: one branch and one pull
  request for each change, and the checks before each pull request.
- Do not add a dependency. If RF or SAR checks need one (for example
  PySar4seq), stop and ask the user.
- Do not test a rule that pypulseq already tests (rely on pypulseq).
- A proposal to pypulseq or to MATLAB Pulseq stands alone. It does not name
  `pulseq-reports` or `pulseq-checks`.

## 11. Decisions

The user made these decisions on 2026-09-30. Do not open them again.

| # | Decision | Answer | Where |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `Card.checks` and exit status 2, against `0.2.0` | Remove them before `0.2.0` final. | 9 |
| 2 | The exit status of `pulseq-report` when a check in its summary fails | 0. The opt-in flag `--fail-on-check` gives a non-zero status. | 5.6 |
| 3 | The exit status of "not evaluated" | Status 1 only for a required check (a check that the caller names). A default check that is not evaluated does not change the status. | 5.6 |
| 4 | The limits of the sequence (`seq.system`) | Only with an explicit opt-in. The result records the source of the limits. | 5.6 |
| 5 | The rasters of the file and of the target | A separate raster check. The target profile gives the rule (equal, or an integer multiple). The timing check uses the rasters of the target. | 5.10 |
| 6 | The target profile format | A TOML or JSON file that can name a Siemens `.asc` file. A value in both files is an error. | 5.2 |
| 7 | The speed budget | Cost classes (`fast`, `slow`) and a tested budget for the fast checks of the library. The user's condition: other developers must be able to add their own checks easily. The cost class is one field, with the default `slow`. | 5.9 |
| 8 | `HardwareLimits` | It moves to `pulseq-checks`. `pulseq-reports` exports it again. | 5.2, 9 |
| 9 | The command-line code | Each package has its own. `pulseq-checks` has a public function that reads a check configuration, and `pulseq-reports` uses it. | 5.7 |
| 10 | The location of the convention declaration | Deferred. It is a TODO. Version 1 has no convention checks. | 6.2 |
| 11 | The worst case under rotation | Worst-case amplitude (the peak of \|G\|) in version 1. Worst-case slew later, after a vector slew measurement. | 8 |
| 12 | The name and the repository | `mdtisdall/pulseq-checks`: public, MIT, with the same dev-workflow as `pulseq-reports`. | 9 |

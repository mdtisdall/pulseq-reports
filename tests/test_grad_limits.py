# ---- Comparisons with the oracle (task 4.4) ----
#
# `tests/oracles/grad_limits.py` is the implementation from before phase 4 of
# docs/plans/cards-at-scale.md. It reads every block with `get_block` and has no junction
# steps. The random sequences below build every gradient event so that it starts and ends at
# 0, so every block junction step is 0 (the junction tests above cover the junction steps on
# their own, against hand-computed values, as docs/plans/cards-at-scale.md section 4.6 item 6
# says to). With no junction contribution, the new code's slew is the segment part only, so
# the whole result can be compared with the oracle's.
#
# The new code sums and maxes per unique event; the oracle sums and maxes per block, after
# adding that block's own start time to the event's corner points before differencing them
# for a slope. When a sequence plays one event in several blocks at different start times
# (for example `tests/synthetic.gre_sequence`'s readout, once each TR), the oracle gets a
# very slightly different slope for the same event at each occurrence: each corner time
# `start + offset` is rounded to about machine eps times the start time, and a slope divides
# the difference of two such times by the segment's duration. The tolerance is therefore
# derived from each sequence (the user, 2026-09-28): `1e-12 + 4 * eps * duration / shortest
# segment` (`_rounding_tol`), relative to the value or to the limit of the same kind. The
# oracle can also credit a peak or a slew of a repeated event to a later block, from the
# same rounding, so these general comparisons check only whether a block is credited; the
# dedicated block-attribution tests above use events that are not repeated and check the

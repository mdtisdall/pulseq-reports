"""Gradient spectrum of a Pulseq sequence, and its largest values in the acoustic
resonance bands that the caller gives.

Oracle: the implementation before phase 5 of docs/plans/cards-at-scale.md. Do not
change its method. A resonance is a pair (frequency_hz, bandwidth_hz), the centre
frequency and the full width of its band in Hz, as in the library; the default is no
resonance.

`gradient_spectrum` uses the same method as pypulseq's
`calculate_gradient_spectrum`: 50 ms Hann windows with 50% overlap, the
magnitude spectrum of each window, and the maximum over windows. pypulseq
stops sampling at the last gradient point and starts the first window at 0.
Here the gradients are sampled to the end of the sequence and padded with half
a window of zeros at each end, so a sequence shorter than one window still has
a spectrum and gradients near either end are not attenuated by the window.

The gradients are sampled in chunks of `CHUNK_WINDOWS` windows, so the memory does not
grow with the length of the sequence. Each chunk starts at a multiple of the hop and
overlaps the next chunk by one window less one hop, so the chunks give the same windows
as one spectrogram of the whole padded waveform.

"""The gradient waveform of one axis at given times, from the sequence index.

The waveform is the polyline of pypulseq's `Sequence.get_gradients()`, in Hz/m:

1. The points. For each block, in play order, that has an event on the axis: the
   corner or sample points of that event (`seq_utils.gradient_offsets`), at the times
   `(block start + delay) + offsets`, with the event's amplitudes.
2. The join. The points of all these blocks make one list. A point whose time is not
   more than `pypulseq.eps` (1e-9 s) after the time of the point before it in the list
   is left out. pypulseq's `waveforms()` leaves out the first point of an event at the
   time of the last point of the event before it, so the step at such a junction takes
   the value of the earlier event. The same rule removes the repeated points that
   `gradient_offsets` gives inside some events (for example a trapezoid without a flat
   time), which have the same value.
3. The values. Straight lines between consecutive points, also across a gap between
   two events. 0 before the first point and after the last point.

`GradientSampler.block_samples` gives a second form of the same waveform, for the PNS
lane (section 4.1, item 3, of docs/plans/diagram-lanes.md): each block on its own, at
the local times `(j + 0.5) * dt` from the block start, with the rule of the browser's
`PnsLanes` (`assets/pns_lanes.js`): the block's own event, 0 outside it. It has no line
across a gap, and no time drift from the block start sums.

"""How near a sequence's gradients get to the hardware limits.

Each gradient event is piecewise linear between the points that `seq_utils.gradient_points`
gives, as the Pulseq specification treats it. This module computes, for each logical axis
(x, y, z) and for the three-axis vector, the peak amplitude, the peak slew rate, and the RMS
amplitude over a time range, and compares the peak amplitude and the peak slew rate with the
hardware limits.

The axes are the logical sequence axes, not the physical gradient axes of a scanner. The
scanner rotates the logical axes onto the physical ones for the prescribed orientation, so on
an oblique slice one physical axis can see amplitude up to the vector peak,
`GradientLimits.vector_peak_mt_per_m`, even when no single logical axis is near the limit.

This computes the per-event values one time for each unique gradient event
(`seq_index.grad_events`), then combines them over the blocks of `seq_index.sequence_index`
with numpy, instead of reading every block with `get_block` (`docs/plans/cards-at-scale.md`,
section 4.6). It reads individual blocks only for the few blocks that a window edge cuts.

The peak slew rate is the largest of two kinds of value (decision 6 of section 2.5 of the
plan): the slope of each straight segment of each gradient event, and the step at each block
junction divided by `grad_raster_time` (`Sequence.add_block` checks this step). The step uses
0 for a block with no event on the axis, and 0 before the first block.

    gradients, on each logical axis and as a three-axis vector, compared with
    `limits`.

    With `window=None`, the range is the whole sequence, `(0.0, total_duration)`.
    Otherwise `window` is `(start_s, end_s)` in seconds from the sequence start; it
    must have `start_s < end_s` and lie within the sequence
    (`0.0 <= start_s` and `end_s <= total_duration`, each within `TIME_TOLERANCE`),
    or this function raises `ValueError`. A gradient piece that crosses a range edge
    is cut at the edge, with the amplitude at the edge found by linear interpolation.
    With `window` given, `GradientLimits.whole_rms_mt_per_m` also gives each axis's RMS
    over the whole sequence, computed in this same call.

    With `limits=None`, the limits are `seq.system.max_grad` and `seq.system.max_slew`
    (see `HardwareLimits`).

    This builds `seq_index.sequence_index(seq)` and the per-event values of
    `seq_index.grad_events` one time (`_event_values`), then combines them with numpy over the
    blocks of the range. It reads individual blocks with `get_block` only for the few blocks
    that a range edge cuts, so its cost does not grow with the number of blocks the way that
    reading every block would.

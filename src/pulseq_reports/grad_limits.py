"""How near a sequence's gradients get to the hardware limits.

Each gradient event is piecewise linear between the points that
`seq_utils.gradient_points` gives, as the Pulseq specification treats it. This module
computes, for each logical axis (x, y, z) and for the three-axis vector, the peak
amplitude, the peak slew rate, and the RMS amplitude over a time range, and compares
the peak amplitude and the peak slew rate with the hardware limits.

The axes are the logical sequence axes, not the physical gradient axes of a scanner.
The scanner rotates the logical axes onto the physical ones for the prescribed
orientation, so on an oblique slice one physical axis can see amplitude up to the
vector peak, `GradientLimits.vector_peak_mt_per_m`, even when no single logical axis
is near the limit.

"""The block table of one sequence, in play order, with dense event indexes.

`sequence_index` reads `seq.block_events` and `seq.block_durations` one column at a
time, without `get_block`, so it costs O(N) for N blocks with no per-block pypulseq
call. It numbers the unique RF, gradient and ADC events from 1, in the order of their
first use in play order, as `diagram_data.diagram_tables` numbers them. The three
gradient axes share one index space: in one block, gx comes before gy and gz.

`rf_events`, `grad_events` and `adc_events` give each unique event one time, from the
first block that uses it. Only they call `get_block`, with the block cache off
(`block_cache_off`): pypulseq keeps every block that `get_block` reads in
`seq.block_cache` when `use_block_cache` is True, and nothing removes it.

    """Raise `NotImplementedError` when `seq` uses the Pulseq rotation extension.

    The cards that use the gradients show the logical gradient events as they are
    stored. With a rotation in a block, the gradients on the scanner are different, so
    these cards would be wrong without a warning. They call this function first.

    The check reads no block, so its cost does not grow with the number of blocks. It
    finds a rotation in two ways:

    - a non-empty `seq.rotation_library`. pypulseq 1.5.0.post1 has no such attribute.
      The rotation extension of pypulseq draft PR #372 adds it, and `make_rotation`
      events in `add_block` fill it.
    - `"ROTATIONS"` in `seq.extension_string_idx`. In PR #372, `Sequence.read` adds
      it for a file with an `extension ROTATIONS` section.

    Limit: pypulseq 1.5.0.post1 cannot make a rotation, and its `Sequence.read` raises
    `ValueError` ("Unknown section code: extension ROTATIONS ...") for a file with
    rotations. Thus, with that version, no sequence with rotations gets to this check.
    A later pypulseq that stores rotations in a different way can get past it.

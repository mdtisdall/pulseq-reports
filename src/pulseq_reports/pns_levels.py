`pns_levels` samples the gradients block by block (`GradientSampler.block_samples`),
runs the SAFE model of the pinned pypulseq fork over them in chunks
(`_safe_gwf_to_pns_chunk`, which carries the filter state from one chunk to the next),

    of the gradient .asc file `asc_path`, or pypulseq's example hardware when it is None
    (as `pns.pns_prediction` chooses them, with `pns.read_gradient_asc`,
    `pns.hardware_name` and `pns.EXAMPLE_HARDWARE`).

    The model is `calc_pns` of the pinned fork, on other samples:

    1. `dt = seq.grad_raster_time`. The samples are `GradientSampler.block_samples` of
       each axis (Hz/m), divided by `seq.system.gamma` (T/m), as `calc_pns` divides.
       When a block is not on the raster (`on_raster` False), the samples are
       `GradientSampler.sample` at the file times `(k + 0.5) * dt`, as `calc_pns`
       samples, with `k = 0 .. ceil((end - 1e-10) / dt) - 1` and `end` the end of the
       last block (`calc_pns` stops at the last gradient point instead; the samples
       after it are the decay of the filters).
    2. The samples go through `_safe_gwf_to_pns_chunk` in chunks of `chunk_samples`
       samples (default: the whole number of bins nearest at or above
       `CHUNK_SAMPLES`; a keyword for the tests, and it must be a whole number of
       bins), with `state=None` for the first chunk and the returned state after.
    3. The axis values are `0.01 *` the returned percent, and the total of a sample is
       `sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)` of them, with the numpy operations of `calc_pns`
       (`np.sqrt((comp ** 2).sum(axis=1))`).
    4. The level: the minimum and the maximum of the total in each bin of
       `bin_samples_for(num_samples, dt)` samples (the last bin can be shorter), cast
       to float32 outward: the minimum rounds down and the maximum rounds up
       (`numpy.nextafter` when the cast value is on the wrong side), so that each
       stored bin holds every total of its samples.
    5. The summary: the peak (float64), the axis peaks, and the peak time: the time
       `(k + 0.5) * dt` of the first sample whose total is at or above
       `peak * (1 - pns.PEAK_TOLERANCE)`, as `PnsPrediction.peak_time_s`. The peak is
       known only at the end, so `pns_levels` keeps the start state of each chunk
       (12 numbers) and the float64 maximum of each chunk, and runs again only the
       first chunk whose maximum reaches the threshold.

    The result does not depend on `chunk_samples` (exact equality). A sequence without
    a gradient event gives `reason=pns.NO_GRADIENTS`, no bins, peak 0 and
    `peak_time_s` None. Memory: the chunk, the longest block, the stored level and a
    few numbers for each chunk.

    Raises NotImplementedError for a sequence with the rotation extension
    (`extensions.refuse_rotations`), as the other gradient cards do.
